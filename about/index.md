#poza aici
My name is Andrei Telerez, an aspiring programmer within the games industry. During my first two years of University, I have completed projects on my own and as part of a team. This allowed me to gain invaluable skills such as:


<ul>
    <li>The ability to adapt</li>

    <li>Teamwork Efficiency</li>

    <li>Resource management</li>
</ul>


Having to complete various projects within different teams allowed me to get familiarised with multiple game engines and programming languages such as:



Unity - C#

Unreal Engine - C++/Blueprints

GameMaker - GML
