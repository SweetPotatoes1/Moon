My name is Andrei Telerez, an aspiring programmer within the games industry. During my first two years of University, I have completed projects on my own and as part of a team. This allowed me to gain invaluable skills such as:


<ul>
    <li>The ability to adapt and learning new technologies</li>
    
    <li>How to research properly</li>

    <li>Teamwork efficiency</li>

    <li>Resource management</li>
</ul>


Having to complete various projects within different teams allowed me to get familiarised with multiple game engines and programming languages such as:


<ul>
    <li>Unity - C#</li>
    <li>Unreal Engine - C++/Blueprints</li>
    <li>GameMaker - GML</li>
</ul>
